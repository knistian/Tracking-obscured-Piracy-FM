# Tracking-obscured-Piracy-FM
Creating and design of a FM-transmitter-structure of robust, hard to track, FM-based piracy transmitter structure. 

Hardware/Software project.

Need help from people with good knowledge in RF-technology, IP and IP-security.


==================================

Title: Transmiter-strategy for “untraceable” Piracy FM broadcast
----------------------------------

Background:
----------------
The state of Norway has built a (Digital Audio Broadcast)DAB-network, and has, from 2018, outlawed FM-transmission on a national basis. Thus monopolized the radio-media in the country.  
The national monopoly is threatening free speech. 

The government of Norway has rewarded broadcasting licence only to its own, Governmentally supported broadcaster Monopoly together with a foreign, commercial (big-capital) broadcaster.  This foreign channel are only transmitting music and small talk anyways, so they are not really a threat to the ruling regime.
This second broadcaster will also never go against the ruling regime in fare of loss of future broadcast licenses. 

Aim of project:
-------------------
Creating and design of a FM-transmitter-structure of robust, hard to track, FM-based piracy transmitters. To obscure the transmitter locations, the transmitter structure and the back-end feed-source. Project is aiming at going broadly out in serache to identify all relevant tracking techniques and build strong counter measures. Based on the tools, construct transmitter units with the best and most complete built in countermeasures and build the software back end for feeding payload signal to the system in an obscured way.

Design goals:
-------------------
•	What transition techniques exist that can be used as tools for hiding or obscure transmitter locations?

•	Multi-transmitter-matrix

•	Fast Time switching

•	Frequency switching

•	Transmitter-strengh-switching

•	Interference-problematics

•	«sleaping-agent-transmitter» Slow time switching.

•	Large number of transmitter-agents.

•	Short-frequency-offset, parallel transmition(like tunnel-transmitters)

FM-transmitter-matrix for un-trackable Piracy-transmition
If transmitter-element(agent) is tracked down,located and seaced by the Authorities, the rest of the system still will be able to obscure the rest of the transmitter-structure and ensure feed-anonymity, obscurity of audio-source-feed and other agents.

Structure-Elements:
-----------------------
•	Audio-source (studio)

•	Audio-feed-network(IP-network)

•	Agent-Status-feedback(IP-network)

•	Sync mechanism (GPS, w. GPS-jammer-detect)

•	Transmitter-agent(unit) w. tracking counter measures

•	Antennas,  w. tracking counter measures (directionality?, visual dessign(hard to spot, hard to access)






Controll-strategy:
--------------------
CPU

* communication-interface
* anti-hacking-strategy(the devise will be exposed to the internet somehow, with all that comes with it)
* Strategy to be robust against DoA from Tracking authorities

Back-end(Audio-Feed and status-return):
-------------------------------------------
* optimal Physical layer (low tracability: laser/electric/radio/ultrasound/IP by pigeon :-) )
* obscure internet-routing (Tor? Torrent? "dark web"? )

Front-end(transmition)
----------------------
* Counter-measures against RF-tracking.
* transmitter-strategy, tools and trix for obscuring the transmitters in the structure.
analyze the techniques for tracking down priat-transmitters, and see if the techniques can be used against tracters.

Possible trix/tecqniques:
-------------------------
* Multi-transmitter-matrix

* Fast Time switching(he individual agent is active in time-slots

* Frequency switching( in case of frequenzy-jamming by the authorities, shift network working-frequency)

* Transmitter-strengh-switching(detere trackers from using signal sterngth to locate transmitter)

* «sleaping-agent-transmitter» Slow time switching. (let many agents sleep, and reconfiggute whole network structure, so the tracker have to starte all over again.

* Large number of transmitter-agents. The more, the better, so larger presentage of the agents can sleep at any given time.

* Short-frequency-offset, parallel transmition(like FM-tunnel-transmitters) For targeting the Interference problematics of multy transmitter techniques

* GPS-coordination of transmitter frequenzy by PLL to the 1PPS beat.(is it posible?) .

* GPS-jamming by the authorities: Posible way to make single agent or part of the network out of sync.

* Agent-counter-measure is multi-GPS-antenna, with position-comparison.(If the GPS-signal come from a GPS-simulator, the Location of the satelites will look alike, compared to real satelites)

Problems and Limitations:
----------------------------
Interference-problematics
Interference between agents: can it be used constructively?

* System will be unpractical for mobile reseption. (Even with two close transmition-frequenzies(tunnel-transmitter recnique?)

* can stationarry reseption be acheived with acceptable reseption quality?
