# Tracking-obscured-Piracy-FM
Creating and design of a FM-transmitter-structure of robust, hard to track, FM-based piracy transmitter structure. 

Hardware/Software project.

Need help from people with good knowledge in RF-technology, IP and IP-security.


==================================

Title: Transmiter-strategy for “untraceable” Piracy FM broadcast
----------------------------------

Background:
----------------
The state of Norway has built a (Digital Audio Broadcast)DAB-network, and has, from 2018, outlawed FM-transmission on a national basis. Thus monopolized the radio-media in the country.  
The national monopoly is threatening free speech. 

The government of Norway has allowed only its own, Governmentally supported broadcaster Monopoly together with a foreign, commercial (big-capital) broadcaster.  This foreign channel are only transmitting music and small talk anyways, so they are not really a threat to the ruling class.
This the later broadcaster will also never go against the ruling regime in fare of loss of future broadcast license. 

Aim of project:
-------------------
Creating and design of a FM-transmitter-structure of robust, hard to track, FM-based piracy transmitters. To obscure the back-end feed-source, and transmitter structure, with the help of all tools in the tool-box. 

Design goals:
-------------------
What transition techniques exist that can be used as tools for hiding or obscure transmitter locations?

Multi-transmitter-matrix
Fast Time switching
Frequency switching
Transmitter-strengh-switching
Interference-problematics
«sleaping-agent-transmitter» Slow time switching.
Large number of transmitter-agents.
Short-frequency-offset, parallel transmition(like tunnel-transmitters)

FM-transmitter-matrix for un-trackable Piracy-transmition
If transmitter-element(agent) is located, still will obscure the rest of the transmitter-structure and ensure feed-anonymity, obscurity of audio-source-feed.

Structure-Elements:
-----------------------
•	Audio-source (studio)
•	Audio-feed-network(IP-network)
•	Agent-Status-feedback(IP-network)
•	Sync mechanism (GPS, w. GPS-jammer-detect)
•	Transmitter-agent(unit) w. tracking counter measures
