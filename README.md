# Tracking-obscured-Piracy-FM
Creating and design of a FM-transmitter-structure of robust, hard to track, FM-based piracy transmitter structure. 

Hardware/Software project.

Need help from people with good knowledge in RF-technology, IP and IP-security.


==================================

Title: Transmiter-strategy for “untraceable” Piracy FM broadcast
----------------------------------

Background:
----------------
The state of Norway has built a (Digital Audio Broadcast)DAB-network, and has, from 2018, outlawed FM-transmission on a national basis. Thus monopolized the radio-media in the country.  
The national monopoly is threatening free speech. 

The government of Norway has rewarded broadcasting licence only to its own, Governmentally supported broadcaster Monopoly together with a foreign, commercial (big-capital) broadcaster.  This foreign channel are only transmitting music and small talk anyways, so they are not really a threat to the ruling regime.
This second broadcaster will also never go against the ruling regime in fare of loss of future broadcast licenses. 

Aim of project:
-------------------
Creating and design of a FM-transmitter-structure of robust, hard to track, FM-based piracy transmitters. To obscure the transmitter locations, the transmitter structure and the back-end feed-source. Project is aiming at going broadly out in serache to identify all relevant tracking techniques and build strong counter measures. Based on the tools, construct transmitter units with the best and most complete built in countermeasures and build the software back end for feeding payload signal to the system in an obscured way.

Design goals:
-------------------
What transition techniques exist that can be used as tools for hiding or obscure transmitter locations?

Multi-transmitter-matrix
Fast Time switching
Frequency switching
Transmitter-strengh-switching
Interference-problematics
«sleaping-agent-transmitter» Slow time switching.
Large number of transmitter-agents.
Short-frequency-offset, parallel transmition(like tunnel-transmitters)

FM-transmitter-matrix for un-trackable Piracy-transmition
If transmitter-element(agent) is located, still will obscure the rest of the transmitter-structure and ensure feed-anonymity, obscurity of audio-source-feed.

Structure-Elements:
-----------------------
•	Audio-source (studio)

•	Audio-feed-network(IP-network)

•	Agent-Status-feedback(IP-network)

•	Sync mechanism (GPS, w. GPS-jammer-detect)

•	Transmitter-agent(unit) w. tracking counter measures
