Transmitter-module, the RF-part:

Quality-goal: The transmitter should send a signal that in quality would be good enough for proffesional audio transmision, 
however:  it would not carry any ID-information, only the stereo sub-carrier.  

*Should not interfere with other channels, but maintain a clean band-limited, and none overmodulated signal.

*Frequency range: Full FM-range: 87-108 MHz

* PLL-controlled. Programmable transmition frequency, to set the transmitter with high presition over a large range 
of the FM-frequency range

* Transmitter should have built in mecanisms for tracking counter measures. Gain control, Frequency control, Fast on-off, for seem-les switch between agents

* PLL locked to GPS-1PPS to ensure network-wide syncronisation of transmitter frequency- and agent-hoping and other time-critical counter-measures.



Antenna: separate project.
